```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <p>This is some text.</p>
</div>
```
In this case, there is no actual bug. The original code is correct.  The issue might arise from:

1. **Missing or incorrect Tailwind CSS configuration:** Ensure Tailwind CSS is correctly installed and configured in your project. 
2. **Incorrect import:** Verify that Tailwind directives are correctly imported in your CSS or JavaScript file.
3. **Conflicting CSS:** Check for any conflicting CSS rules that might override the Tailwind CSS styles.
4. **Browser issues:** It's rare but sometimes a specific browser or browser extension can cause rendering problems.
